Mapping and Binning a Metagenome Assembly
=========================================

A common approach following metagenome assembly is binning, a process by which assembled contigs are collected into groups or 'bins' that might then be assigned some taxonomic affiliation. There are many different tools that can be used for binning (see `CAMI review for more details<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/09/099127>`__). Here, we will be using `MaxBin<https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-2618-2-26>`__, which is both user friendly and highly cited. To use MaxBin, we will first need to map our data against the assembled metagenome using bwa and then estimate relative abundances by contig. We will then inspect the bins generated by MaxBin using VizBin.

Mapping
=======

Download bwa::

  cd
  curl -L https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2/download > bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2

Unpack and build it::

  tar xjvf bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2
  cd bwa-0.7.15
  make

Install it::

  sudo cp bwa /usr/local/bin

Downloading data
-----------------

Now, go to a new directory and grab the data::

  mkdir ~/mapping
  cd ~/mapping

  curl -O https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dib-training.ucdavis.edu/metagenomics-scripps-2016-10-12/SRR1976948.abundtrim.subset.pe.fq.gz
  curl -O https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dib-training.ucdavis.edu/metagenomics-scripps-2016-10-12/SRR1977249.abundtrim.subset.pe.fq.gz

And extract the files::

  for file in *fq.gz
    do
    gunzip $file
  done

We will also need the assembly; rather than rebuilding it, you can download a copy that we saved for you::

  curl -O https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dib-training.ucdavis.edu/metagenomics-scripps-2016-10-12/subset_assembly.fa.gz
  gunzip subset_assembly.fa.gz

Mapping the reads
-----------------

First, we will need to to index the megahit assembly::

  bwa index subset_assembly.fa

Now, we can map the reads::

  for i in *fq
    do
        bwa mem -p subset_assembly.fa $i > ${i}.aln.sam
    done


Converting to BAM to quickly quantify
-------------------------------------

First, index the assembly for samtools::

  samtools faidx subset_assembly.fa

Then, convert both SAM files to BAM files::

  for i in *.sam
    do
      samtools import subset_assembly.fa $i $i.bam
      samtools sort $i.bam $i.bam.sorted
      samtools index $i.bam.sorted.bam
    done

Now we can quickly get a rough count of the total number of reads mapping to each contig using samtools::

  for i in *sorted.bam
    do
      samtools idxstats $i > $i.idxstats
      cut -f1,3 $i.idxstats > $i.counts
    done

Binning
=======

First, install MaxBin::

   cd
   curl  https://downloads.jbei.org/data/microbial_communities/MaxBin/getfile.php?MaxBin-2.2.2.tar.gz > MaxBin-2.2.2.tar.gz
   tar xzvf MaxBin-2.2.2.tar.gz
   cd MaxBin-2.2.2
   cd src
   make
   cd ..
   ./autobuild_auxiliary
   export PATH=$PATH:~/MaxBin-2.2.2

Binning the assembly
--------------------

Finally, run the MaxBin! Note: MaxBin can take a lot of time to run and bin your metagenome. As this is a workshop, we are doing three things that sacrifice *quality* for *speed*. 1) We are only using 2 of the 6 datasets that were generated for the this project. Most binning software, including MaxBin, rely upon many samples to accurately bin data. And, we have subsampled the data to make it faster to proess. 2) We did quick and dirty contig estimation using samtools. If you use MaxBin, I would recommend allowing them to generate the abudance tables using Bowtie2. But, again, this will add to the run time. 3) We are limiting the number of iterations that are performed through their expectation-maximization algorithm (5 iterations instead of 50+). This will likely limit the quality of the bins we get out. So, users beware and read the user's manual `here<https://downloads.jbei.org/data/microbial_communities/MaxBin/README.txt>`__ before proceeding with your own data analysis.

First, we will get a list of the count files that we have to pass to MaxBin::

  cd ~/mapping
  mkdir binning
  cd binning
  ls ../*counts > abundance.list

Now, on to the actual binning::

  run_MaxBin.pl -contig ../subset_assembly.fa -abund_list abundance.list -max_iteration 5 -out mbin

This will generate a series of file. Take a look at the files generated. In particular you should see a series of *.fasta files preceeded by numbers. These are the different genome bins predicted by MaxBin.

Take a look at the mbin.summary file. What is shown?

Now, we are going to generate a concatenated file that contains all of our genome bins put together. We will change the fasta header name to include the bin number so that we can tell them apart later. ::

  for file in *fasta
    do 
      num=${file//[!0-9]/}
      sed -e "/^>/ s/$/ ${num}/" mbin.$num.fasta >> binned.concat.fasta
    done
    
And finally make an annotation file for visualization::

  echo label > annotation.list
  grep ">" binned.concat.fasta |cut -f2 -d ' '>> annotation.list
  
Visualizing the bins
--------------------

Now that we have our binned data there are several different things we can do. One thing we might want to do is check the quality of the binning-- a useful tool for this is CheckM. We can also visualize the bins that we just generated using VizBin.

First, install VizBin::

  cd
  sudo apt-get install libatlas3-base libopenblas-base
  curl -L https://github.com/claczny/VizBin/blob/master/VizBin-dist.jar?raw=true > VizBin-dist.jar

VizBin can run in OSX or Linux but is very hard to install on Windows. To simplify things we are going to run VizBin in the desktop emulator through JetStream (which is ... a bit clunky). So, go back to the Jetstream and open up the web desktop simulator. 

.. thumbnail:: ../files/VizBin-OpenDesktop.png
   :width: 50%

Open the terminal through the desktop simulator and open VizBin: ::

  java -jar VizBin-dist.jar
 
This should prompt VizBin to open in another window. Click the choose button to open file browser to navigate to the binning folder (~/mapping/binning). There you will find the concatenated binned fasta file (binned.concat.fasta). Upload this file and hit run.

What do you see? Read up a bit on `VizBin<https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-014-0066-1>__` to see how the visualization is generated. 

Now, upload the annotation.list file as an annotation file to VizBin. The annotation file contains the bin id for each of the contigs in the assembly that were binned.

How do the two binning methods look in comparison?
